# auby_project

## Getting Started:

* Start by installing Flutter/Dart and a compatible IDE (I recommend VSCode)
* Clone the following project into your system and open it through a Flutter compatible IDE
* Run "flutter packages get" into the the terminal inside the project
* Open a mobile simulator, iOS or android.
      (My method is by running "flutter emulators --launch ios" in the terminal)
* Once your IDE detects a mobile simulator (if you are using VSCode, there's a label on the bottom right corner), you can launch the application (if you are using VSCode, you can either launch it through Debugging mode or running "flutter run" in terminal)
